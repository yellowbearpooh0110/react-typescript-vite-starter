# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

If you are used to React applications built with `create-react-app`, you might expect to wait a few seconds before the development server starts. With Vite, I see the following message in less than a second.

```
  VITE v4.1.4  ready in 1485 ms

  >  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  >  Network: use --host to expose
  >  press h to show help
```

### `npm run preview`

This command will boot up a local static web server that serves the files from dist at http://localhost:4173 . It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment. You may configure the port of the server by passing the --port flag as an argument.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
